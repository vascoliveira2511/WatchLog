## **🔍 DEBUGGING TIPS**

### Check Browser Console:
- Open Developer Tools (F12)
- Look for these success messages:
  - "Loaded user stats: {data}"
  - "Rating saved successfully" 
  - "Watch status updated successfully"
  - "Loaded watchlist: {data}"

### Check Network Tab:
- Monitor TMDB API calls (image.tmdb.org)
- Monitor Supabase API calls
- Look for 200 status codes

### Common Issues:
- **Images not loading**: Check next.config.ts image domains
- **Auth errors**: Check Supabase environment variables  
- **TMDB errors**: Check TMDB API key configuration
- **Database errors**: Check Supabase database schema
