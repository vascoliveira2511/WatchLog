- [ ] Code is committed to Git
- [ ] Repository is pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Repository is public or accessible to Vercel

### External Services Setup

#### Supabase (Database & Auth)
- [ ] Supabase account created at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- [ ] New project created (choose any name/region)
- [ ] Database schema applied:
  - [ ] Go to SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query
  - [ ] Copy entire `supabase/schema.sql` content
  - [ ] Execute SQL successfully

## üöÄ Vercel Deployment

### Import Project
- [ ] Vercel account created at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- [ ] GitHub account connected to Vercel
- [ ] WatchLog repository imported to Vercel
- [ ] Next.js framework auto-detected

### Environment Variables
Add these in Vercel dashboard during import or in Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables:

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://your-project.supabase.co`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = `your-supabase-anon-key`
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_TMDB_API_KEY` = `your-tmdb-api-key`
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` = `random-32-character-string`
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_URL` = `https://your-app.vercel.app` (update after first deploy)

### Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET
Choose one method to generate a secure secret:
- [ ] **Online**: https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32
- [ ] **Command**: `openssl rand -base64 32`
- [ ] **Node.js**: `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64'))"`

### First Deployment
- [ ] All environment variables added
- [ ] **Deploy** button clicked
- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] App URL received (like `watchlog-abc123.vercel.app`)

### Post-Deployment Configuration
- [ ] Copy actual Vercel app URL
- [ ] Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` environment variable with real URL
- [ ] Redeploy triggered (automatic when env vars change)
- [ ] Final deployment successful

## ‚úÖ Testing Your Deployment

### Basic Functionality

- ‚úÖ All main features work
- ‚úÖ Search returns TMDb results
- ‚úÖ Database operations work (marking watched, etc.)

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Fails**
- Check all environment variables are set
- Verify no typos in variable names
- Make sure all required dependencies are in package.json

**Can't Sign Up**
- Verify Supabase URL and anon key
- Check Supabase project is active
- Confirm database schema was applied correctly

**Search Doesn't Work**
- Verify TMDb API key is correct and active
- Check browser console for API errors
- Ensure CORS is properly configured

**Authentication Issues**
- Make sure NEXTAUTH_SECRET is set and secure
- Verify NEXTAUTH_URL matches your actual domain
- Check that auth callbacks are working

### Getting Help
- Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
- Review Vercel function logs in dashboard
- Verify Supabase logs in dashboard
- Check environment variables are correctly set

## üîÑ Ongoing Maintenance

### Automatic Updates
- [ ] Push changes to GitHub ‚Üí Vercel auto-deploys
- [ ] Environment variables updated as needed
- [ ] Monitor Vercel analytics for performance

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add custom domain in Vercel settings
- [ ] Set up monitoring/analytics
- [ ] Configure error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Add more TMDb API features
